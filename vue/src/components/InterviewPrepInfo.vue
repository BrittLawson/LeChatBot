        <h1>Prepping for Your Interview</h1>
        <p>Interviewing begins the moment you receive a call or email from the recruiter informing you that 
          they're interested in scheduling an interview. From that moment until the day of your interview, 
          you need to ensure that you're as prepared as possible. If you go into any interview without a 
          level of preparation, it will not go well. Preparation is key when interviewing for roles in the 
          tech industry.</p>
