           Hi Name, 
          </p>
          <p>
            I appreciate having the opportunity to speak with you today about the Software Developer 
            role at the ABCD company. The job seems to be a perfect match for my abilities and interests.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to my enthusiasm, I would bring strong communication skills, flexibility, and the 
            ability to encourage others to work cooperatively. During our conversation, I noted that at one 
            point you stressed your need for a Junior Software Developer to quickly become a productive member 
            of the team. Please know that I am more than happy to "go the extra mile" and can ensure that I 
            would put in the extra work as needed to get up to speed.
          </p>
          <p>
            I appreciate the time you took to interview me, and I look forward to hearing from you about the 
            next steps in the hiring process.
          </p>
          <p>
            Again, thank you very much for your time and consideration. I hope to hear from you soon.

            Hi Name,
          </p>
          <p>
            Thank you so much for meeting with me today to discuss the Junior Developer position at Tech Company. 
            I really enjoyed our conversation, and believe my background in developing apps makes me a strong 
            match for this position.
          </p>
          <p>
            As I mentioned in our conversation, I've developed similar apps during my time at Tech Elevator, 
            have studied several programming languages, and am comfortable working as part of a team to ship 
            products on time and as bug-free as possible. While at Tech elevator, one of the apps that I helped 
            develop as a side project received 2nd place at a Hackathon. My proven track record working on teams 
            would be an asset to Tech Company, and I am very enthusiastic about this opportunity.
          </p>
          <p>
            I look forward to scheduling the next steps in your process. Thank you again for the opportunity to 
            speak today, and I hope to hear from you soon.
